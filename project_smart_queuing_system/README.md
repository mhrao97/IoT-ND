# Smart Queuing System

## Main Tasks

1. Propose a possible hardware solution
2. Build application and test its performance on the DevCloud using multiple hardware types
3. Compare the performance to see which hardware performed best
4. Revise proposal based on the test results

## Part 1: Hardware Proposal

### The Scenarios

We've provided three different scenarios that depict real-world problems based on different sectors where edge devices are typically deployed.
The three scenarios you'll be looking at are:
* Scenario 1: Manufacturing Sector
* Scenario 2: Retail Sector
* Scenario 3: Transportation Sector

### Hardware Proposal: 
All of the scenarios involve people in queues, but each scenario will require different hardware. So your first task will be to determine which hardware might work for each scenarioâ€”and then explain your initial choice in a proposal document.    

Later, after you've built and tested your application on each hardware device for all three scenarios, you'll review the results and validate or update your initial proposed choices in the proposal document.    

## Part 2: Testing your Hardware

Build out the smart queuing application and test its performance on all four different hardware types (CPU, IGPU, VPU, and FPGA) using the DevCloud.    

### Check Your Work:

Before submitting your project, ensure the following items are complete:    

* `person_detect.py` is complete and in the workspace directory.
* `queue_job.sh` is complete and in the workspace directory.
* All three Jupyter Notebooks are complete and in the workspace directory.
* `results` directory contains output files for all three scenarios in the workspace directory.
* Upload a `PDF` version of the hardware proposal document to the workspace directory below.

### Upload your Proposal Document:

You will need to upload a `PDF` version of your hardware proposal document to the workspace directory.   

### Submit your Project for Review.
